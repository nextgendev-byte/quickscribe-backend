1
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,560
I can't believe you're here right now.

2
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,120
How could you have died?

3
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,760
How?

4
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,960
That can't be real.

5
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,720
We've had a long way to go with you,
 brother.

6
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,240
I wish...

7
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,520
I wish I hadn't hung out this long after
 Alaca left the club.

8
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,720
You wouldn't have thought of this
 party, either.

9
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,280
You'd be looking at your job for strength.

10
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,800
And none of that would happen.

11
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,760
Forgive me, brother.

12
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,560
I don't dare look at your face.

13
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
Please, forgive me.

14
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,960
I'm sorry, Professor.

15
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,240
We have to take it now.

16
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,200
Bye, brother.

17
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,040
Of course, we'll see you again.

18
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,240
Bye.

19
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,800
Yep.

20
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,600
Did you find his place?

21
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,240
I know the hospital.

22
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,800
Okay, thanks.

23
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,320
I'm so sorry bro, too.

24
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,640
The call never deserved it.

25
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,640
Why did this happen, brother?

26
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,200
I don't know, Gokhan.

27
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,760
Life...

28
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,640
... gives us the answers to some
 questions later.

29
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,520
We will live and learn.

30
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,160
Let's see what else life can teach us.

31
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,040
God, I don't understand.

32
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,560
I'm gonna freak out eventually.

33
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,640
Come on.

34
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,840
Come on, son.

35
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,800
I'm already holding myself hard.

36
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
I don't know, brother.

37
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,440
I really don't know anything anymore.

38
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,160
What should I do, huh?

39
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,720
Tell me what to do?

40
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,080
Our best days have passed with The Call.

41
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,160
If it wasn't for him...

42
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,920
I was a jerk in America.

43
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,280
What we ate and what we drank would
 not go apart.

44
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,520
His family...

45
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,360
He would see me as his son.

46
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,360
The latest...

47
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,880
... When I got on the phone with Aunt
 Gülseren...

48
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,040
...” My son is entrusted to you.”

49
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,680
What am I gonna tell him now, huh?

50
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,240
Yes Tolga Abi...

51
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,600
How do I tell him your brother's dead huh?

52
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,240
Abi!

53
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,600
Still no answer?

54
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,840
No, I can't reach.

55
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,320
Dad, did you learn anything?

56
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,640
I found out which hospital he was in.

57
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm going there now.

58
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,880
All right.

59
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,360
Which hospital? I'll come, too.

60
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,640
No. Unique.

61
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,480
We can't go there like the family goes to
 visit the community.

62
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,920
It's not our hospital.

63
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,360
I'm gonna go.

64
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
I'll find out everything.

65
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,480
You will be waiting to hear from me.

66
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,200
Dad, please.

67
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,840
- I want to be with Kenan. - Don't insist.

68
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,640
I know what I'm saying.

69
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,120
Daughter, that's what your father said,
 which he knew.

70
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,640
All right. All right, Dad.

71
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,360
My daughter.

72
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,880
Don't cry anymore.

73
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,720
You've ruined yourself.

74
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,520
Look, it's too bad for you.

75
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,480
Shame on me?

76
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,240
Shame on the original call.

77
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,480
Because of me, the young man left.

78
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,360
Because of you?

79
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,400
Oh, what kind of word is that?

80
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,880
If I hadn't come into their lives, they
 would be alive now.

81
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,600
He was in the gym now, maybe he was
 at work.

82
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,520
Maybe they went to the movies with
 Jasmine.

83
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,200
Maybe he was talking to his mother.

84
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,920
Maybe...

85
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,920
Look, girl.

86
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,600
It will not be lived with beggars,
 nor with monks.

87
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,200
It means that the foreword is like that.

88
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,600
Turan, I wish he'd killed me.

89
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,200
If he'd killed me, if he hadn't done
 anything to him.

90
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,800
Girl, what a way you talk!

91
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,560
Don't do that.

92
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,720
Look, you have a beautiful girl.

93
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,280
Think about it for a bit.

94
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,640
Come on, don't do that.

95
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,400
You have to stand strong.

96
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,120
Look, girl...

97
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,360
Look, he's sleeping inside now.

98
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,320
Coming to her in a moment...

99
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,680
If he sees you crying in a fountain with
 two eyes like that...

100
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,920
Will it ever be?

101
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,720
Look, you're gonna stay strong...

102
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,920
... so he can hold on to you.

103
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,960
First of all, you are a mother.

104
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,600
Don't forget that, please.

105
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,080
That bastard will serve his sentence.

106
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,920
Don't worry about it.

107
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,520
The wick will come through the wick nose.

108
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,280
My daughter, don't cry anymore.

109
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,240
Don't cry.

110
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,560
Hello. Pinarcissus, are you available?

111
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,080
Yes, I'm listening, dear.

112
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,840
We don't have any information.

113
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,480
But my father found out about the
 hospital that the Call stayed.

114
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,840
He's even going there now.

115
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,720
Which hospital was it?

116
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,960
He didn't tell me either.

117
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,120
But my father would call if there was
 any improvement.

118
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,080
What am I saying, do you have a call 
to find out where they are?

119
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,120
All right.

120
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,640
Okay, honey, I'll try.

121
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,680
If I get any news, I'll call.

122
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,480
All right.

123
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,240
All right, then, we'll get in touch,
 honey.

124
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,160
All right, then, we'll get in touch, honey

125
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,040
I'll see you.

126
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,560
I think Jasmine will sleep longer.

127
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,040
And you're here.

128
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,320
If I go and see Kenan.

129
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,960
It's miserable now.

130
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,400
So, of course, go, girl...

131
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,760
I didn't know, what would I do when I
 woke up?

132
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,560
I mean, when you wake up, he wants 
to see what he wants to see.

133
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,640
You're right. You're right.

134
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,240
When Jasmine awakens, I will come to
 Kenan.

135
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,280
It would be good.

136
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,880
And Kenan is not alone.

137
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,480
He's got Gokhan with him.

138
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,320
You're right.

139
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,200
Don't stay up, sit down late.

140
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,840
Late, baby, late.

141
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,840
Ah, my Alaca.

142
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,080
Baki Bey.

143
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,520
Kenan.

144
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,200
I found out this morning from Yiricik.

145
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm sorry, of course.

146
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,080
So I'm here to see if there's anything I
 can do.

147
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,200
Thank you.

148
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,040
Thank you, too...

149
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,520
Where did the only one hear it?

150
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,560
He talked to Pinar.

151
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,640
He said it.

152
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,560
Of course, Biricik was also very upset.

153
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,320
Yeah...

154
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,760
Why did you bring it here?

155
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,200
I wish you had brought it to our hospital.

156
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,440
We'd take care of your friend in private.

157
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,040
If the ambulance was the nearest
 hospital, he brought it there.

158
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,400
I couldn't intervene because I wasn't
 there at the time.

159
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,760
Anyway.

160
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,560
These are not important.

161
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
What matters is the life of your friend.

162
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,240
How's he, okay?

163
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,720
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,000
We lost the call.

165
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,240
I'm so sorry.

166
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,360
Thank you for your head.

167
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,800
Thank you, Baki.

168
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,960
Is there anything I can do for you?

169
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,280
Right now I just want to be alone.

170
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,200
I'm sorry, please.

171
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,840
You can tell the only one.

172
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,360
Please don't come.

173
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,880
All right.

174
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,480
How would you feel good.

175
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,600
I don't know how to do it yet, but...

176
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,320
I still have to meet Call's family.

177
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,360
So I need to get my act together in a
 moment.

178
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,640
Because of the pain I'm going through...

179
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,680
I don't want anyone to come and
 comfort me.

180
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,200
I understand you.

181
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,680
Don't worry at all.

182
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,400
Whatever you want, everything will be
 like that.

183
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,360
Thank you again for your head.

184
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,080
Hello.

185
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,960
Where are you?

186
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,360
Okay, I'm coming.

187
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,040
Where is this idiot?

188
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,560
The person you are looking for cannot
 be reached at this time.

189
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,880
No, she's still off the phone.

190
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,640
If I knew what was going on.

191
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,360
What if this idiot Turan got caught?

192
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,120
Then you're ruined, you're done.

193
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
Was there anything else I could help?

194
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,680
No. Thanks for everything.

195
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,800
You're welcome.

196
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,240
I guess I was parodying it.

197
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,000
Attribution.

198
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,000
What's the name of the boy you got
 that organ from?

199
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,560
Call someone named Levent.

200
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,600
God damn it!

201
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,160
What happened?

202
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,480
Are you sure?

203
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,000
It's nice.

204
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,200
Look, this is very good news.

205
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,640
I think you can handle this very quickly.

206
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,320
All right. I trust you.

207
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,480
You said he was a young man, didn't you?

208
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,760
And the organ was not damaged at all.

209
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,600
Is it true?

210
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,480
So, does blood and tissue keep harmony?

211
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,760
Yes, there are a few risky situations,
 but...

212
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,360
This is the donor we're looking for.

213
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,600
One minute, one minute.

214
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,080
Wait, I'm thinking something.

215
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,000
All right.

216
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,400
All right.

217
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,360
Sometimes for someone to live...

218
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,120
Unfortunately, someone has to lose
 their life.

219
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,480
Do what needs to be done.

220
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,200
The patient's condition is already
 not very good.

221
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,280
Having found such a suitable donor...

222
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,960
... can't wait.

223
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,760
Is there a problem, Baki?

224
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,400
I assure you.

225
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,840
Everything is as we know it.

226
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,440
It was done in the usual way.

227
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,880
There is no such thing as to arouse doubt.

228
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,360
Attribution can't be a problem with 
the method anyway.

229
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,240
I designed that method step by step.

230
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,880
The problem is with the deceased.

231
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,640
In the person who died?

232
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,960
The dead boy turned out to be familiar.

233
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,560
That wasn't good.

234
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,920
Security cameras as usualwere 
broken during the operation?

235
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,360
Yes, yes.

236
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,600
Don't worry, there will be no 
problem with cameras.

237
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,360
So how much of this kid's liver did 
you take?

238
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,960
Here is 70-80 percent.

239
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,920
Did this kid live another minute after 
the operation?

240
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,520
It took him an hour or two to die.

241
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,720
There is no doubt in him either.

242
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,040
So it will raise any doubts, has 
nothing happened?

243
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,360
No, Mr. Baki.

244
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,720
Attribution, you still review 
everything one by one.

245
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,040
We have to think about even
 the slightest possibility.

246
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,280
Okay, Mr. Baki.

247
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,840
You'll let me know.

248
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,480
You command.

249
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,800
Baki, you ordered me.

250
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,840
Salih. Salih.

251
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,440
That man gave you all the trouble?

252
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,880
I don't understand, Baki.

253
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,080
You don't understand, do you?

254
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,960
You didn't understand.

255
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,840
Let me tell you.

256
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,080
I used to give you a job.

257
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,800
You'd know it down to the smallest detail.

258
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,840
Now I'm giving you a job.

259
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,720
You can't even find out the most
 important point.

260
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,920
Baki, if I have a problem, tell me.

261
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,680
I'll make it up to him right now.

262
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,480
Salih!

263
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,200
You will learn everything from the 
beginning, not after it happens.

264
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,400
You have this coyote you're questioning...

265
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,560
He stabbed Kenan's friend.

266
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,640
Is Kenan Bey's friend?

267
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,360
“Is Kenan a friend of Bey?”

268
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,040
Do you know what it's called?

269
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,600
Call.

270
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,920
Call Levent.

271
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,080
Do you know what happened to the
 man, Salih?

272
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,480
He's dead.

273
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,560
He's dead, he's dead!

274
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Do you understand?

275
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,440
He's dead!

276
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,120
Do your job properly!

277
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,400
The guy in his hand is walking around
 like a knife.

278
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,920
He's stabbing.

279
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,560
You don't know.

280
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,040
You used to dust off the iron when you
 hit it with your hand.

281
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,800
Now your hand is like cotton.

282
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,000
Excuse me, Baki, I-

283
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,480
Don't talk, don't answer me.

284
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,400
Do your job.

285
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,040
Now go to that man!

286
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,080
Do you break your fingers or break your
 legs,

287
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,440
Take your teeth out, whatever you do,
 talk to that man!

288
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,520
Do you understand?

289
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,080
I understand, Baki.

290
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,640
Get out of my sight!

291
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,920
“Was Kenan a friend of the Lord?”

292
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,520
Stupid bastard!

293
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,480
If I don't do everything or learn
 everything, the world has no idea!

294
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,160
I'll call you later.

295
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,480
I'm not available right now.

296
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,800
I'll get some air.

297
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,240
Previously...

298
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,440
I always thought this kind of thing
 happened to other people.

299
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,480
My brother was stabbed first.

300
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,600
And then my best friend.

301
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,880
Life...

302
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,760
He forgave me my brother.

303
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,280
But my best friend...

304
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,360
He took it away from me.

305
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,120
So how are we going to deal with them?

306
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,480
We won't be able to cope.

307
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,760
We'll just get used to it.

308
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,360
The time will come...

309
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,960
... will close our ears.

310
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,960
It will make our hearts callus.

311
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,160
This way we will get used to it.

312
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,960
Kenan...

313
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,960
Your presence gives me strength.

314
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,920
Whenever I have a headache...

315
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,320
I think Kenan has a shoulder.

316
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,440
Would you feel that way too?

317
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,360
We're going to get through this together.

318
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,360
Abi!

319
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,720
Look at me!

320
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,680
Brother, what did I do again?

321
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,920
Boy, you walk around the neighborhood
 and dust

322
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,800
Are you confusing me with coyotes?

323
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,120
Damn you!

324
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,840
Brother, I don't understand anything.

325
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,920
What do you mean, brother?

326
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,600
I've been sitting here all day, doing
 nothing, bro.

327
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,200
Turan!

328
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,680
Turan!

329
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,480
My son, to tear this from the sins that
 you have done

330
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,720
Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?

331
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
This is not a court, my lion.

332
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,400
You make him a judge in court.

333
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,080
Unless, of course, I can cut it before
 then.

334
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,280
Why are you mad at me again?

335
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,480
Brother, what did I do?

336
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,840
Didn't I tell you everything, I love your
 eyes, brother?

337
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,040
I told you everything.

338
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,200
So you told me everything!

339
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,080
Yeah.

340
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,720
Boy, you stabbed a man.

341
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,360
Why don't you tell me?

342
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,120
How do I know it's important?

343
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,360
I mean, sometimes I stab a guy, bro.

344
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,560
If you're talking about this last
 incident...

345
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,000
Abi pulled up, came out and hit me.

346
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,120
I had to.

347
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,600
I stabbed me out of necessity.

348
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,080
I had to.

349
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,840
I swear I had to, brother.

350
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,240
I love your brother's eye.

351
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,000
I told you everything.

352
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,960
So you're stabbing a guy, huh, Turan?

353
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,040
You hide something from me again...

354
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,520
No.

355
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,120
I'll cut off those fingers of yours.

356
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,720
Come on, let's see.

357
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,480
Let's see who's a psychopath.

358
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,400
Abi.

359
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,560
God, I'm going crazy, help me.

360
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,440
Sir Pinar, sir, what is it?

361
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,080
I was just wondering how you were
 doing, Gokhan.

362
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,520
You wondered how I was doing?

363
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,920
Let me tell you.

364
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,520
Because of you, because of me,
 a young friend of ours died.

365
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,960
Because of the evil we both have done...

366
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,560
... the young human being will enter 
the land of the Pınar.

367
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,480
If you have a little conscience, tell me.

368
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,000
How should I be?

369
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,400
Tell me!

370
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,200
Gokhan, I'm curious about you, but
 I don't have it.

371
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,840
Don't worry, Pinar, I'm not gonna be okay.

372
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,120
I'm not going to be any good from now on.

373
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,240
I won't be any better from now on.

374
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,320
[What am I going to do now, what am I
 going to do?]

375
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,880
[If this idiot is caught...

376
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,840
What if he talks about everything...

377
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,240
... then I'll be ruined.]

378
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,160
[I hope without being a retard

379
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,600
Thou hast not escaped with that 
effigy, Turan.]

380
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,240
[No, not here so I can't wait.]

381
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,680
[I have to go and do something.]

382
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
Dad, welcome.

383
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,840
Seconds.

384
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,520
Can you get me a whiskey?

385
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,440
Dad, what happened? Is there any
 news of The Call?

386
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,360
Dad, please say something.

387
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,520
I'm going to die of curiosity. How was
 the call?

388
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,680
Thanks, Seconds.

389
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,080
Bon appetit, sir.

390
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,600
The situation is not very good.

391
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
Unique...

392
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,840
Unfortunately, the Call passed away.

393
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,760
Oh, my God!

394
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,280
It's terrible.

395
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,320
What will her parents do now?

396
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,080
It is not a bearable pain.

397
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,120
I need to call Kenan right now.

398
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,480
I even have to go with him.

399
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,920
I'll get out right now.

400
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,680
Wait, wait, sit down, Biricik.

401
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,000
Just calm down first. Look...

402
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,240
Kenan thinks he'll let his family know
 right now.

403
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,520
And then he has to do a lot of other
 things.

404
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,360
You'd better not go and stay here.

405
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,720
Dad, so...

406
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,240
He's the man I'm going to marry.

407
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,840
If I am not with him in this painful day,
 when will I be?

408
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,040
Okay, I understand.

409
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,520
But now Kenan needs to be left alone.

410
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,040
Look, I wanted to stay.

411
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,560
He didn't accept my help either.

412
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,360
We also have his...

413
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,640
... we need to hear that thought.

414
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,200
Okay?

415
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,800
I mean, it's better if you don't leave and
 stay here.

416
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,320
You go to him when he comes to himself.

417
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,960
Dad, you don't understand me at all.

418
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,160
You don't act like that if you understand.

419
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,400
I want to be with the man I love.

420
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,320
I want to share his pain.

421
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,280
Unique.

422
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,320
Daughter, your father is only Kenan,
 even you now

423
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,520
He says he can't see it.

424
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,480
Look, he doesn't want her around, he
 wants to be alone.

425
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,720
I understand you very well.

426
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,240
I'd think of it as if I were you.

427
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,040
But let Kenan get to his senses.

428
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,280
Princess, sit back.

429
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,840
Calm down a little.

430
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,720
Think about it.

431
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,200
I'm sure you'll make healthier decisions.

432
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,400
I don't want to think about anything.

433
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,560
Melody.

434
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,920
Gokhan.

435
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,680
I'm in a lot of pain.

436
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,880
In order not to cry all the time next to
 the silk, I run away somewhere.

437
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,680
Emel's sister is also looking at her
 thankfully.

438
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,200
I can keep up with you playing games
 or something.

439
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,280
How am I supposed to look at you and
 Canaan's face?

440
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,640
I can't even breathe without suffering
 anymore.

441
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,320
Melody, please.

442
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,280
Please don't say anything, Gokhan.

443
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,800
I don't know how I'm going to live with
 this torment of conscience.

444
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,520
It's like a knife is cutting me in half.

445
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,200
I can't stand it anymore.

446
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,120
Melody, we all suffer.

447
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,400
But we're gonna wrap these wounds
 together.

448
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,360
If it wasn't for me, there wouldn't be a
 wound like this.

449
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,680
The call was now alive.

450
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,760
That's why I will never forgive myself.

451
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760
And not at all.

452
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,000
This is what happens if you cooperate
 with such an idiot, Pinar.

453
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,040
So go ahead and get that car, get out
 of here.

454
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,880
You can't be as smart as you can't
 figure it out!

455
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,840
And you're getting really into the mafia
 business, Pınar.

456
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,760
If you don't have a job, destroy this car
 now.

457
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,920
Where is the alaca?

458
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,760
Jasmine just walked up to her.

459
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,880
I just spoke to Ezgi.

460
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,440
She sounded so bad.

461
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,560
Shall we talk about this later, brother?

462
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,880
Brother, please.

463
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,960
She's already miserable.

464
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,000
What's her fault if a maniac is after her?

465
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,400
Gokhan.

466
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,720
Even if he is right...

467
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,200
I'm not in a position to think this is
 healthy right now.

468
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,880
Okay?

469
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,040
The person who suffers...

470
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,400
He thinks through his pain.

471
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,360
No matter how sad we are...

472
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,240
She's so sad, bro.

473
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,000
That coyote stabbed you, Gokhan.

474
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,000
Before I'm glad you're getting better

475
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,840
He took my best friend from me.

476
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,720
What do you expect me to think?

477
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,680
Look, brother.

478
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
I just need some time.

479
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,400
Just a little time.

480
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,960
A mountain fell on me.

481
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,400
Please don't expect me to get up from
 gold in a day.

482
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,720
Hello Tolga brother.

483
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,840
How will the laughing aunt get through
 this pain?

484
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,520
He will never make it through.

485
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,680
He won't make it through.

486
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,160
How much life he has left...

487
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,240
He will live with this pain.

488
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,000
What's his...

489
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,520
... nor Tolga's brother...

490
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,080
He won't laugh at any time.

491
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,640
They will breathe and breathe.

492
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,920
But he's not gonna be name-calling, is he?

493
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,560
Whenever they see a knife...

494
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,800
That knife will be stick into their hearts

495
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,360
There's this bastard...

496
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,600
... ruined everyone's lives.

497
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,240
Yours, mine, Aunt Gülsaran, Tolga's
 brother, Jasmine.

498
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,720
And now he walks around waving his
 hand to the armhole.

499
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,880
My son!

500
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,080
My mother!

501
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,720
My mother!

502
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,480
Let my breath pass to you, Mother.

503
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,000
Chalk.

504
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,960
Get up! Son, get up!

505
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,360
Get up, boy!

506
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,480
I beg you, Mom, get up, Mom, get up!

507
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,600
- Get up, boy! -Mom!

508
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,640
Mom!

509
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,640
Mom!

510
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,880
Doctor! Call a doctor!

511
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,600
Mom!

512
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,680
Mom, what happens!

513
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,080
Help! Doctor!

514
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,360
Mom, get up!

515
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,520
Mom, get up! Mom!

516
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,000
Mom, get up! Get up, what happens!

517
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,680
Get up, Mom!

518
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,440
I'm so sorry.

519
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,000
Unfortunately, we lost the call.

520
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,280
My teacher.

521
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,360
Do you think everything was going well?

522
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,080
The surgery was successful.

523
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,760
So what happened all of a sudden now?

524
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,320
Believe me, I don't know either.

525
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,880
The values fell so quickly that we did
 not understand them.

526
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,240
I'm sorry.

527
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,560
I'm so sorry.

528
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,600
Sure.

529
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,120
Where's Abi?

530
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,920
Wait for me here, I'll be right here.

531
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,760
Orhan Hoca.

532
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,960
Oh, my Master Kenan, come on.

533
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,760
When I saw you, I wanted to come and
 talk to you.

534
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,040
I have some questions that come to
 mind as well.

535
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,040
What's it about?

536
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,480
It's about the death of the Call.

537
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,680
The situation was stable.

538
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,640
Everything was going well, too.

539
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,040
Yeah, that's exactly what it was.

540
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,760
Since everything was going well...

541
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,200
... why did the Call die suddenly?

542
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,760
So why did he suddenly go into septic
 shock?

543
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,400
I can't find the answers to these
 questions.

544
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,360
Mr. Kenan, if you want, let's go to my
 room and talk there.

545
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,880
Let's not talk like that, shall we?

546
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,440
- Glad. - Here you go.

547
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,520
Here you go, Master.

548
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,920
My teacher, believe me, I don't
 understand what caused it.

549
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,040
Actually, I've been thinking about it for
 two days.

550
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,120
How could it be?

551
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,080
So you have the same doubts, sir?

552
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,320
I mean, I'm the only one who doesn't
 think so.

553
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,120
It exists because in the middle there is
 a very unusual tablethat can be said.

554
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,520
With the rest of the call after the
 operation

555
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,400
There is a big difference between the
 values immediately before death.

556
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,720
One minute, one minute.

557
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,520
What are the differences, Professor?

558
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,840
Now, if there is another patient,

559
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,600
and if I were to say something
 according to the values I have

560
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,640
As the cause of death, I call it organ
 failure.

561
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,120
Organ failure?

562
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,760
How do you mean?

563
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,720
To the point where I am surprised, this is
 exactly the Kenan Teacher.

564
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,000
Although all the findings
 indicate organ failure

565
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,160
There is no reason for this.

566
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,640
ü,If you'll excuse me, can I look at 
these reports?

567
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,840
Yes, of course, sir.

568
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,920
You were right, Professor.

569
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,120
It's really interesting.

570
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,080
Gokhan, never mind where I'm going.

571
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,400
Are the Tolga brothers here?

572
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,320
Hah, okay.

573
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,520
Now you take Tolga's brother and go
 down to the garden.

574
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,760
I'll be there in ten minutes.

575
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,840
Don't ask questions or do what I say,
 come on.

576
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
Why is this trail so long?

577
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,560
Two different stitch marks.
